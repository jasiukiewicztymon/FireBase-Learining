# Setting up FireBase

First of all you have to connect yourself to the FireBase and go to the console. One time in the console you have to click the ```New project``` button.

Next choose a name for your project, choose if you want the analytics and one time this done you have created your first FireBase project. Now you should be on a screen
which should be something like that.

This is center of your application from there you can manage a FireStore, Realtime Databse, Storage, ect... In this notes we'll focus on the FireStore in a web application.
To start click on the web button on the center of the page.

Now you should be on a page that ask you to input the project name and setup the hosting if you want to (in our case we **don't check** the hosting parameters). 

Finnally you can copy the config for the ```npm``` version and copy it to the ```index.js``` file.
